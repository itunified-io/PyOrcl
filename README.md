# PyOrcl: Python Oracle Management Framework

**PyOrcl** is a Python-based framework designed for managing Oracle environments efficiently. It provides tools and classes to handle various Oracle-related tasks, such as event notifications, database management, and automation workflows.

The framework is modular, with each class focusing on a specific aspect of Oracle management. Each class is documented in its own dedicated `README.md` file located in the `classes` directory, ensuring clear and detailed guidance for developers.

## Features
- **Event Management**: Automate event notifications using the `OEMNotification` class.
- **Database Operations**: Manage Oracle databases efficiently with dedicated classes.
- **Modular Design**: Each functionality is encapsulated in a separate class for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Cross-Version Support**: Compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3+.
